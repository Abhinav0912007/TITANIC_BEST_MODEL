# TITANIC_BEST_MODEL
This repository contains an end-to-end supervised learning project using the Titanic dataset. The goal is to predict passenger survival based on features such as age, sex, class, and other attributes. Multiple machine learning algorithms are implemented, compared, and tested to evaluate their performance.
Key features:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Training multiple supervised learning models

Comparing model performance

Evaluation using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

Visualizations of data and results
Algorithms Implemented

The project implements and compares the following supervised learning algorithms:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Usage

Data preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize/scale features.

Train models: Run the provided script/notebook to train multiple algorithms.

Compare performance: Evaluate models using Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices.

Make predictions: Use the best-performing model to predict on the test dataset.

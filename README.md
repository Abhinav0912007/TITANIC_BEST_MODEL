# TITANIC_BEST_MODEL
This repository contains an end-to-end supervised learning project using the Titanic dataset. The goal is to predict passenger survival based on features such as age, sex, class, and other attributes. Multiple machine learning algorithms are implemented, compared, and tested to evaluate their performance.
